#C programs supports 
i)for loop 
ii)while loop - (Entry controlled loop)
iii)do while loop -(Exit controlled loop)
vi)nested loop

For a proper loop we need to use three things as common 
1)Intilization
2)Condition
3)Increment/Decrement

#While Loop
The While loop geeting executed til the condition being tested remins true
The while must test a condition eventually becomes false,otherwise the loop would keep getting executed forever,indefinitely
